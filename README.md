# Research Questions
1. Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

# Regression Algorithms
1. Random Forest Classisfier
2. Gradient Boosting Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine
    - Linear SVC
    - Polynomial SCV
    - Radial Basis Function SVC
    - Sigmoid SVC
  

# Experimental Design
CRISP Methodology  <br />
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

# Setup and Installations
- Google Collabs/ Jupyter Notebooks  <br />
- Python Libraries: <br />
	* Pandas  <br />
